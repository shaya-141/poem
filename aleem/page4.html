    <h2>Dreams of Flight</h2>
    <p>In the silence of the night, when the stars are shining bright,
       I imagine wings that stretch so wide, they can hold me up for flight.
       In the windswept canyons of my dreams, I can fly, so free,
       Leaving earthly troubles far below, and taking to the sky.</p>
    <p>In the peaceful, timeless moment of that night,
       I am the soaring eagle, and I can ride the breeze.
       I can let go of all my cares and fears, and know the weightless bliss
       Of simply being, in the sky.</p>
